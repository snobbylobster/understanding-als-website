Let me help you plan the next steps for Pterosaur.



Key Questions for Core Functionality:

1. Content Organization:
- Do you want the ability to create content templates for different types of pages (e.g., research pages vs. treatment pages)?
- Should the app maintain different schema templates for different content types?
- How would you like to handle content versioning - full page versions or just schema/metadata versions?

2. Deployment Strategy:
- Would you like automated scheduled deployments or manual control only?
- Do you need staging environment support before production deployment?
- How would you like to handle rollbacks - page-by-page or site-wide snapshots?

3. SEO Management:
- Do you want automated internal link suggestions based on content relationships?
- Should the app track and report on broken external links?
- Would you like automated schema validation before deployment?
