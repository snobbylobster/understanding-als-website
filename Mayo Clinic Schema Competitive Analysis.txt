===================================
I can analyze the Mayo Clinic page and provide insights into schema strategy.

Let me check Mayo Clinic's schema implementation:

Based on Mayo Clinic's #1 ranking and what I can see from their page structure, here are key insights for our schema strategy:

1. Mayo Clinic's Advantages:
- Domain Authority: They're a renowned medical institution
- Content Organization: Clear hierarchical structure
- Medical E-A-T signals: Clear medical authorship and review process
- Rich Medical Schema: They're likely using comprehensive medical schema markup

2. Strategy to Compete:
- Implement MORE detailed schema than Mayo Clinic:
  * Include ICD-10 codes (which I don't see on their page)
  * Add clinical trial references
  * Include more specific medical entity relationships
  * Add research paper citations in schema
  * Include more detailed medical condition stages
  * Add schema for patient resources and support groups

Let me create an enhanced schema example that would go beyond Mayo's implementation:

Key differences in our enhanced schema approach:

1. More Comprehensive Medical Coding:
- Including both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes
- Adding medical specialty relationships
- Including clinical guideline references

2. Deeper Disease Information:
- Detailed staging information
- Related drug information
- Diagnostic procedure details

3. Authority Signals:
- Citations to medical literature
- References to recognizing authorities
- Links to international organizations

4. Better Content Organization:
- Clear stage progression
- Multiple audience types
- Comprehensive drug information

To compete with Mayo Clinic, we should:
1. Implement this enhanced schema across ALL pages
2. Create unique schema variations for each content type
3. Keep schema fresh with regular updates
4. Include more research citations than Mayo
5. Add more detailed patient resource schema
6. Include clinical trial schema references

Would you like me to create schema templates for other page types in our site structure?
