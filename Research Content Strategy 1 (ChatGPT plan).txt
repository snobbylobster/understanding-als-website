RESEARCH CONTENT STRATEGY (per ChatGPT):


ME asking ChatGPT:  Let's now pivot to thinking through the research side of things. Consider yourself an early-career PhD candidate who is considering going into ALS. You want to familiarize yourself with the research, but you need more than a layman's view of things. You expect to go to a website with deep explanations for scientists that use the same language as peer reviewed research papers. For example, you are curious about the "mechanisms of action" of ALS, whatever statistical analyses has been done on links to environmental correlations, global incidence and prevalence rates, and even emerging research. What could be the top search terms you would be typing into Google?

===================================

ChatGPT's response.

As an **early-career PhD candidate exploring ALS research**, you would likely search for terms that reflect the **scientific complexity, statistical analyses, and emerging hypotheses** surrounding the disease. Below are **20 high-value research-oriented search queries** that UnderstandingALS.org should target to attract scientists and researchers.

---
